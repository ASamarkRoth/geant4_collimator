Examination seminar

Background/motivation:
Confident, trustworthy and reliable results -> new nuclear structure
Characterise Compex crystals -> Scanning system (show illustrations)
Focused, pencil beam -> collimator. It came to our attention that an integrated cone structure can decrease scattered and this is relevant in the amount of full energy gammas that can be used (however more important in other scanning systems). 

Objective:
Examine whether such a structure can increase the scattering efficiency and evaluate its use in our scanning system with Geant4.
	Scattering efficiency
	Beam divergence
	Required source activity for 1 kHz count rate
